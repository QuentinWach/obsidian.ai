### ðŸš€ Feature Ideas
Of course, there already exist a bunch of native extensions for obsidian.md. But I wanted a custom solution I can quickly change as I want. Maybe so do you. I think it is very powerful and a lot more features can be thought of. Indeed, features for obsidian.md based on LLMs have been discussed [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/adding-built-in-llm-ai-support-to-stay-relevant/72954) as well. Some things I am thinking of are:

+ creating new organizing/header-notes to group together related notes
* making this an obsidian-native extension
* adding meta data automatically
* live prompting inside obsidian.md
* using a local LLM (since it aligns more with the spirit of obsidian to OWN your work and tools) e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OergqWCdFKc
* creating and exporting flashcards automatically
* suggest topics and literature to explore further
* make use of [STORM](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm)

[This project](https://github.com/zatevakhin/obsidian-local-llm) could be cool to adapt, too.
