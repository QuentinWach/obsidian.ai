A simple, free and open `Python3` script to quickly organize your markdown notes in Obsidian.md using **OpenAI**’s large language models. Any random, untagged, empty, or unlinked notes? No more. This little script will fill the gabs, connect what belongs together, and even create high level organizing nodes if a specific topic has a lot of notes. 


Again, this script systematically organizes & augments all your notes by

+ 🧠 reading and understanding every note
+ 🏷 remembering potential tags and topics
+ 🧶 linking and tagging up what belongs together
+ 🤯 creating new organizing/header-notes to group together related notes.

### ❓ How to Use
