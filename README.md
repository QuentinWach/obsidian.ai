# 🔮 Augmenting Obsidian.md with AI
<img align="right" width="40%" margin-left="20px" src="images/1x1_image.png"> 

Quickly organize your markdown notes in Obsidian.md using **OpenAI**’s large language models. Any random, untagged, empty, or unlinked notes? No more. This little script will fill the gaps, connect what belongs together, and even create high level organizing nodes if a specific topic has a lot of notes. 


Again, this script systematically organizes & augments all your notes by

+ 🧠 reading and understanding every note
+ 🏷 remembering potential *tags* and *topics*
+ 🧶 [[linking]] and tagging up what belongs together
+ 🎨 graph meta-data of your vault including 
  + a GitHub-like activity timeline
  + a bar-chart of your most popular tags.

### ❓ How to Use
1. Install `Python3` and `pip install matplotlib openai`.
2. Copy-paste the link to your vault's directory and optionally your OpenAI key into the script.
3. Run the script!

It is that easy.
