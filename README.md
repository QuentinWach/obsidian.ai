# üîÆ Augmenting Obsidian.md with AI: Automatic Linking, Tagging, and Grouping!
<img align="right" width="40%" margin-left="20px" src="images/1x1_image.png"> 

A simple, free and open `Python3` script to quickly organize your markdown notes in Obsidian.md using **OpenAI**‚Äôs large language models. Any random, untagged, empty, or unlinked notes? No more. This little script will fill the gaps, connect what belongs together, and even create high level organizing nodes if a specific topic has a lot of notes. 


Again, this script systematically organizes & augments all your notes by

+ üß† reading and understanding every note
+ üè∑ remembering potential *tags* and *topics*
+ üß∂ [[linking]] and tagging up what belongs together
+ ü§Ø creating new organizing/header-notes to group together related notes.

Don't worry! The script is hardcoded to ensure **the process is non-destructive!**

---
### ‚ùì How to Use
1. Install `Python3`.
2. Copy-paste the link to your vault's directory and optionally your OpenAI key into the script.
3. Run the script!

It is that easy.

### üöÄ Feature Ideas
Of course, there already exist a bunch of native extensions for obsidian.md. But I wanted a custom solution I can quickly change as I want. Maybe so do you. I think it is very powerful and a lot more features can be thought of. Indeed, features for obsidian.md based on LLMs have been discussed [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/adding-built-in-llm-ai-support-to-stay-relevant/72954) as well. Some things I am thinking of are:

* making this an obsidian-native extension
* adding meta data automatically
* live prompting inside obsidian.md
* using a local LLM (since it aligns more with the spirit of obsidian to OWN your work and tools) e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OergqWCdFKc
* creating and exporting flashcards automatically
* suggest topics and literature to explore further
* make use of [STORM](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm)

[This project](https://github.com/zatevakhin/obsidian-local-llm) could be cool to adapt, too.
